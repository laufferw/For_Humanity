# Project Setup Checklist

## 1. Define Requirements and Scope
- [ ] **Core Functionality**
  - [ ] Users can send their location and an optional photo.
  - [ ] Data is stored in a database.
  - [ ] Charitable organizations can access and view the data.
- [ ] **Non-Functional Requirements**
  - [ ] Ensure the system is secure (data privacy).
  - [ ] Make the system scalable to handle potentially high traffic.
  - [ ] Ensure the system is reliable and can process data in real-time.

## 2. Choose Your Technology Stack
- [ ] **Frontend**
  - [ ] Framework: React, Vue.js, or Angular.
  - [ ] Mobile Option: React Native or Flutter.
- [ ] **Backend**
  - [ ] Language: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), or Ruby on Rails.
  - [ ] Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational data; MongoDB for NoSQL.
- [ ] **Storage**
  - [ ] Cloud storage service like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.
- [ ] **Hosting**
  - [ ] Backend: Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
  - [ ] Database: Managed services like AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL.

## 3. Set Up the Development Environment
- [ ] **Version Control**
  - [ ] Set up a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- [ ] **Local Development**
  - [ ] Install necessary development tools (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Docker, VSCode).
- [ ] **Project Structure**
  - [ ] Organize the codebase with clear separation between frontend and backend.
  - [ ] Follow the MVC pattern or similar for code structure.

## 4. Design the Database
- [ ] **Tables/Collections**
  - [ ] Users table/collection to store user information.
  - [ ] Reports table/collection to store location, photo, timestamp, and user reference.
- [ ] **Relationships**
  - [ ] Define foreign key relationships if using a relational database.
- [ ] **Security**
  - [ ] Implement encryption for sensitive data.
  - [ ] Ensure secure access with user authentication (e.g., JWT tokens).

## 5. Develop the API
- [ ] **Endpoints**
  - [ ] `POST /report`: To submit location and photo.
  - [ ] `GET /reports`: To retrieve the list of reports for organizations.
- [ ] **Validation**
  - [ ] Validate incoming data (e.g., location format, image size/type).
- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging.

## 6. Build the Frontend
- [ ] **Form**
  - [ ] Create a form to capture location (GPS/manual entry) and an optional photo.
  - [ ] Ensure the UI is user-friendly and accessible.
- [ ] **API Integration**
  - [ ] Connect the form to the backend API to submit data.

## 7. Implement User Authentication
- [ ] **Sign Up/Log In**
  - [ ] Allow users to sign up or log in using email or social accounts.
- [ ] **Access Control**
  - [ ] Ensure only authenticated users can submit reports.
  - [ ] Implement role-based access if needed (e.g., admin vs. user).

## 8. Deploy the Application
- [ ] **Backend**: Deploy the backend service to a cloud provider.
- [ ] **Frontend**: Host the frontend on a static site host like Netlify or Vercel.
- [ ] **Database**: Deploy the database to a managed service for ease of scaling and maintenance.

## 9. Test the System
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Write tests for critical functions (e.g., data submission).
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Ensure that the frontend communicates correctly with the backend.
- [ ] **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Allow potential users to test the system and provide feedback.

## 10. Monitor and Iterate
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring (e.g., using New Relic, AWS CloudWatch) to track system health and performance.
- [ ] **Feedback Loop**: Gather feedback from users and organizations, and make necessary adjustments.

## 11. Prepare for Launch
- [ ] Ensure all systems are secure, stable, and scalable.
- [ ] Create documentation for users and organizations.
- [ ] Plan a soft launch to test with a smaller user base before scaling up.
